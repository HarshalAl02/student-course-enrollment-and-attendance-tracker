Student Course Enrollment & Attendance Tracker
Industry:
Education (EdTech / Academic Institutions)
Project Type:
B2C Salesforce CRM Implementation (Students as primary customers, Teachers/Admins as service
providers)
Target Users:
Students - for enrollment, attendance records, and alerts
Teachers - for tracking class attendance and student participation
Academic Administrators - for monitoring overall attendance trends, reporting, and compliance

1. Problem Statement
In educational institutions, managing student enrollments and tracking attendance manually is
time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers often struggle to monitor attendance for multiple
courses, and students may miss classes without proper alerts. Lack of timely information on student
attendance leads to decreased engagement and poor academic performance. Therefore, there is a
need for an automated system that efficiently manages course enrollments, tracks attendance, and
generates insightful reports while notifying students and staff about absenteeism.

2. Project Overview
The Student Course Enrollment & Attendance Tracker is a web-based application designed to
streamline student enrollment management and attendance tracking in schools and colleges. This
system allows administrators and teachers to:
- Maintain records of students and courses.
- Enroll students in their respective courses.
- Mark and monitor attendance for each class session.
- Generate automated alerts for students with low attendance.
- Produce detailed reports, including attendance percentage per student and course-wise enrollment
statistics.
By digitizing these processes, the system reduces administrative workload, minimizes errors, and
improves communication between teachers and students regarding attendance.

3. Objectives
1. Efficient Enrollment Management:
Maintain accurate student and course records, allowing seamless enrollment and updates.
2. Automated Attendance Tracking:
Enable teachers to mark attendance quickly, with records stored in a centralized database for
easy retrieval.
